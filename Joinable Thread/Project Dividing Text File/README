#Proposed Solution for dividing reading text file with multiple threads.


#Output should be: 
Enter the filename: text.txt
Enter number of threads: 4
Number of lines: 24
Thread 1 works from the line 1 to 6
Thread 2 works from the line 7 to 12
Thread 3 works from the line 13 to 18
Thread 4 works from the line 19 to 24
The main thread is waiting the number of words from thread 1
Thread 1 has 369 words
The main thread is waiting the number of words from thread 2
Thread 2 has 88 words
The main thread is waiting the number of words from thread 3
Thread 3 has 93 words
The main thread is waiting the number of words from thread 4
Thread 4 has 239 words
Total words in file text.txt is 789, working with 4
